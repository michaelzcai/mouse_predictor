This project uses a feedforward neural network to predict future mouse movements. The code for the network is modified from https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning/blob/master/src/network2.py .

To use, download all the files and run mouse.py
- Your mouse positions will be recorded for 60 seconds. The duration and frequency of collection can be changed with the COLLECTION_DURATION and COLLECTION_INTERVAL variables, respectively.
- Afterwards, the network will be trained and a visual will appear showing the network's prediction based on your mouse's movement for the past second.
